# Advanced Wild Animal Detection & Alert System using YOLOv5

This project aims to prevent human–wildlife conflicts by detecting wild animals in real-time using YOLOv5 and triggering alert mechanisms to warn nearby people or authorities.

The system processes video streams from cameras, detects animals, and activates warning signals to help prevent dangerous encounters — especially in forest borders, farms, and village regions near wildlife zones.

# Features

✅ Real-time wild animal detection using YOLOv5

✅ Supports live CCTV / webcam video feed

✅ Alerts through sound alarm

✅ High-accuracy object detection (Elephant, Tiger, Leopard, etc.)

✅ Fast inference & real-time FPS processing

✅ Scalable for drones / forest surveillance units

✅ Can integrate IoT & GPS for advanced deployments

# Tech Stack
Component	Tools
Deep Learning Model	YOLOv5
Framework	PyTorch
Frontend	OpenCV (Live camera feed)
Hardware	Laptop / CCTV camera
Alert System	Buzzer / Speaker alarm (software alert implemented)

# System Workflow
Camera Feed → YOLOv5 Detection → Animal Identified → Alert Triggered


Detection Classes Example:

Elephant

Tiger

Bear

Leopard

Deer

Wild Boar

Wolf etc.



# Running the System
python detect_animals.py


Or for video input:

python detect_animals.py --source wildlife_footage.mp4

# Results

Real-time detection speed: ~30 FPS (GPU) / ~5–10 FPS (CPU)

High accuracy for wild animal classes

Successful alert trigger when wild animal detected

#  Applications
Field	Usage
Forest Dept	Early animal intrusion alert systems
Agriculture	Protect farms near forest areas
Railway Zones	Avoid animal crossing accidents
Smart Villages	Safety monitoring around wildlife zones
Drone Patrol	Aerial animal surveillance
# Future Enhancements

Mobile app alert with GPS location

SMS alert integration (Twilio / IoT SIM)

Drone-based real-time monitoring

YOLOv8 / YOLOv10 migration

Cloud dashboard for live monitoring

Night-vision support for IR cameras

# Project Outcome

This system offers a real-time, AI-powered safety solution to detect wild animals and minimize risk to human lives and agriculture — contributing toward smart wildlife safety systems and human-animal conflict prevention.
